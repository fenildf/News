Immediately, when creating the application, I divided the project into MVP layers.
This makes it easy to work with the desired layers, without affecting others, and the code becomes simpler and more understandable. Writing it first takes more time.

### Description:
Soon
### Используемые навыки и инструменты:
Reactive programming, multithreading, REST API in conjunction with Rx, with caching. Work with SQLite and Shared Preferences.
Work with DB and REST is carried in the background thread.
